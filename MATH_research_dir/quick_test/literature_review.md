- **Non-uniqueness of late-time scaling states in spinodal decomposition** — This paper investigates the late-time scaling behavior of spinodal decomposition, demonstrating that it is *not* necessarily unique, even under identical initial conditions. Using Cahn-Hilliard simulations, the authors show that multiple distinct scaling states with different domain morphologies and scaling exponents can emerge depending on the system's dynamics during early-stage coarsening. This challenges the conventional view of a single, universal scaling regime and highlights the importance of early-stage dynamics in determining the final morphology of phase-separated systems.
- **Energy Estimates for Solutions of Spinodal Decomposition Problem** — Affouf's paper provides rigorous energy estimates for solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a mathematical model describing spinodal decomposition. The work employs techniques involving spectral estimates and Poincaré inequalities to bound the energy of the solution in terms of initial data and model parameters. The paper demonstrates that the energy decays exponentially in time under certain conditions, providing valuable insight into the long-term behavior of solutions to the spinodal decomposition problem.
- **Freezing of Spinodal Decompostion by Irreversible Chemical Growth Reaction** — Schulz and Paul demonstrate that an irreversible chemical growth reaction within a spinodal decomposing mixture can effectively freeze the morphology at an early stage, preventing the system from reaching its equilibrium structure. This freezing occurs because the growth reaction preferentially consumes one of the phases, thereby hindering coarsening and stabilizing the nascent structure. The study uses a Cahn-Hilliard-type model coupled with a reaction-diffusion equation to simulate this phenomenon, showing that the final morphology is determined by the reaction rate and the ratio of reactants, offering a novel pathway to control microstructures in materials.
- **Spinodal decomposition in Bjorken flow** — This paper investigates the dynamics of spinodal decomposition in the context of Bjorken flow, relevant to heavy-ion collisions. It employs a Langevin equation to model the evolution of the order parameter in an expanding system, incorporating stochastic noise and a non-equilibrium equation of state. The study reveals that the system can undergo spinodal decomposition, forming domains of different phases, and quantifies the time scales and length scales associated with this process under realistic Bjorken flow conditions.
- **A priori procedure to establish spinodal decomposition in alloys** — This paper introduces a computationally efficient, a priori method to predict spinodal decomposition in alloys based solely on the alloy's electronic structure. They use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the formation enthalpy as a function of composition and then derive the second derivative, identifying regions of negative curvature that indicate spinodal instability. The method is validated against experimental data for several alloy systems, showing its potential for accelerated materials design by predicting miscibility gaps and decomposition pathways without relying on expensive experimental characterization.
