### Literature Review
- **Non-uniqueness of late-time scaling states in spinodal decomposition** — This paper investigates the late-time scaling behavior in spinodal decomposition using extensive numerical simulations of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The authors employ various initial conditions and system sizes to demonstrate that the system can evolve towards multiple, distinct scaling states characterized by different domain morphologies and scaling exponents. Their findings highlight that the late-time behavior is not uniquely determined by the universality class, suggesting the importance of initial conditions and finite-size effects in dictating the final state of phase separation.
- **Energy Estimates for Solutions of Spinodal Decomposition Problem** — This paper provides rigorous energy estimates for solutions of the spinodal decomposition problem, a fourth-order nonlinear parabolic equation modeling phase separation. The authors employ functional analysis techniques, including the construction of suitable Lyapunov functionals and exploiting the structure of the equation, to derive uniform bounds on the energy and its time derivative. Their findings establish long-time existence and regularity of solutions and confirm the expected dissipative behavior predicted by the underlying physics of the problem.
- **Freezing of Spinodal Decompostion by Irreversible Chemical Growth Reaction** — This paper investigates how an irreversible chemical growth reaction impacts spinodal decomposition in a binary mixture. It employs Cahn-Hilliard-type simulations, incorporating a growth term that consumes one component and converts it into the other. The simulations reveal that the reaction arrests the spinodal decomposition process, freezing the morphology at a specific stage dependent on the reaction rate, leading to a smaller domain size than without reaction.
- **Spinodal decomposition in Bjorken flow** — The paper investigates spinodal decomposition, a phase separation process, in the context of heavy-ion collisions modeled by Bjorken flow. Using a Langevin equation to describe the evolution of the order parameter, the authors simulate the dynamics of phase separation in an expanding system. They find that the Bjorken expansion significantly modifies the spinodal decomposition process, influencing the size and correlation length of the resulting domains, potentially impacting observables like particle correlations.
- **A priori procedure to establish spinodal decomposition in alloys** — This paper introduces a novel computational procedure based on a priori thermodynamic calculations to predict and understand spinodal decomposition in alloys. The method utilizes density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the alloy's free energy and its second derivative, enabling the identification of the spinodal region without relying on experimental data or kinetic simulations. The findings demonstrate the procedure's ability to accurately predict the compositional range and temperature for spinodal decomposition in several alloy systems, offering a computationally efficient way to guide alloy design.
